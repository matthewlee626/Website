For a few weeks, Titan Dev Club has been offering introduction to programming courses to elementary schoolers in the Pasadena area. A few lessons we've learned are:

1. Stay flexible. Course curriculums don't always work for everyone. Make sure to adapt to the progress of students to ensure an effective learning experience.

2. Ask questions. Especially for younger students, being proactive will make sure your understanding of their process is up-to-date.

3. Be kind. Many children are understandably having a difficult time with online schooling, so treat extra lessons as a time for a bit of fun.

4. Have fun with the lessons yourself! The students reflect your enthusiasm.

5. Have appreciation for one's own teachers!
